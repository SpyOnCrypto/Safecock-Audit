<h2>SafeCock Audit Overview</h2>

<h4>SafeCock:</h4>

<p>SafeCock is a community project, centred around a deflationary token, part of the fees of which will go directly to a charity.</p>

<h4>SafeCock Key Point :</h4>
<ul>
  
<li> 6,1% tax (2% burn, 2% added to liquidity pool, 2% redistributed to holders & 0,1% reversed to the sustainability wallet)</li>
<li> Ownership has been renounced yet</li>
<li> Liquidity Pool Locked</li>
<li> supply: 69,000,000,000,000 (69trillion) </li>
<li> Burn wallet: 50% of the total supply</li>
<li> Allocation team: 1% of the total supply</li>
</ul>

<p>With all these informations we didn’t detect any vulnerabilities that could come from outside, the SafeCock smart contract seems safe from the owner & investors perspective as long as the 2% liquidity tax is blocked by the owner over time</p>
